### About

`RustyMoney` is a primitive expense tracker written with Rust. It keeps track of your different accounts, their current balances, and lets you record transactions as they occur.

* Create expense category.
* Create account with balance details.

### TODO

* Ability to record transactions and transfers between accounts.
* Ability to create budgets, and compare budgets with actual spending.
* Dashboard that provides bird's eye view of all account balances.
* Features that provide aggregate data - day-to-day balance details, day-to-day expenditures, 10-day window snapshot for balance amounts.
